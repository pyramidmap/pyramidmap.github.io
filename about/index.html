&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Find Identical：Reports any records in a feature class or table that have identical values in a list of fields, and generates a table listing these identical records. If the field Shape is selected, feature geometries are compared.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rename：Changes the name of a dataset. This includes a wide variety of data types, among them feature dataset, raster, table, and shapefile.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sort：Reorders, in ascending or descending order, records in a feature class or table based on one or multiple fields. The reordered result is written to a new dataset.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Create Database View：Creates a view in a database based on an SQL expression.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalculate FeatureClass Extent：Recalculates the XY, Z, and M extent properties of a feature class based on the features in the feature class.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Table Compare：Compares two tables or table views and returns the comparison results.
</details>
<details>
<summary><b>Attachments toolset</b></summary>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add Attachments：Adds file attachments to the records of a geodatabase feature class or table. The attachments are stored internally in the geodatabase in a separate attachment table that maintains linkage to the target dataset. Attachments are added to the target dataset using a match table that dictates for each input record (or an attribute group of records) the path to a file to add as an attachment to that record.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enable Attachments：Enables attachments on a geodatabase feature class or table. The tool creates the necessary attachment relationship class and attachment table that will store attachment files internally.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disable Attachments：Disables attachments on a geodatabase feature class or table. The tool deletes the attachment relationship class and attachment table.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remove Attachments：Removes attachments from geodatabase feature class or table records. Since attachments are not actually stored in the input dataset, no changes will be made to that feature class or table, but rather to the related geodatabase table that stores the attachments and maintains linkage with the input dataset. A match table is used to identify which input records (or attribute groups of records) will have attachments removed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generate Match Table：Creates a match table to be used with the Add Attachments and Remove Attachments tools.
</details>
<details>
<summary><b>Table Toolset</b></summary>

After the source features are edited, the tool establishes the network connectivity only in the areas that have been edited to speed up the build process; however, when the network attributes are edited, the entire extent of the network dataset is rebuilt. This may be a slow operation on a large network dataset.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dissolve Network：Creates a network dataset that minimizes the number of line features required to correctly model the input network dataset. The more efficient output network dataset reduces the time required to solve analyses, draw results, and generate driving directions. This tool outputs a new network dataset and source feature classes; the input network dataset and its source features remain unchanged.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Create Network Dataset From Template：Creates a new network dataset with the schema contained in the input template file (.xml). All the feature classes and input tables required for creating the network dataset must already exist before this tool is executed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Create Template From Network Dataset：Creates a file containing the schema of an existing network dataset. This template file can then be used to create a new network dataset with the same schema.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make Network Dataset Layer：Creates a network dataset layer from a network dataset.

<summary><b>Server toolset</b></summary>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Find Closest Facilities：Finds one or more facilities closest to an incident based on travel time, distance, or other cost and outputs the best route, chosen facility, and driving directions between the incident and the facility. For example, you can use this tool to find the closest hospital to an accident, the closest police cars to a crime scene, or the closest store to a customer's address.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Find Routes：Finding a route analysis can mean determining the quickest or shortest way to travel between locations. You might want to use this tool to generate driving directions to visit multiple stops or to measure the distance or travel time between locations. The tool is capable of finding routes for one or more vehicles each time it runs, so you can determine the best routes for several drivers to visit preassigned stops, for instance, or measure in a single solve the distance of home-to-work trips for many commuters.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generate Origin Destination Cost Matrix：Creates an origin-destination (OD) cost matrix from multiple origins to multiple destinations. An OD cost matrix is a table that contains the travel time and travel distance from each origin to each destination. Additionally, it ranks the destinations that each origin connects to in ascending order based on the minimum time or distance required to travel from that origin to each destination. The best path on the street network is discovered for each origin-destination pair, and the travel times and travel distances are stored as attributes of the output lines. Even though the lines are straight for performance reasons, they always store the travel time and travel distance along the street network, not straight-line distance.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generate Service Areas：Creates a service area network analysis layer, sets the analysis properties, and solves the analysis. This tool is ideal for setting up a service area geoprocessing service on the web.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn Table To Turn Feature Class：Converts an ArcView turn table or ArcInfo Workstation coverage turn table to an ArcGIS turn feature class.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Update By Alternate ID Fields：Updates all the edge references in turn feature classes using an alternate ID field. This tool should be used after making edits to the input line features that are referenced by the turn features to synchronize the turn features based on the alternate ID fields.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Update By Geometry：Updates all the edge references in the turn feature class using the geometry of the turn features. This tool is useful when the IDs listed for the turn can no longer find the edges participating in the turn due to edits to the underlying edges.
